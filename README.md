1) Place your Bitcoin address after -Wallet in Hashsynminer_start.bat.bat

# Price ticker btc/currency

Choose which Currency you would like bitcoin to be in and stats for that currency "i.e USD, EUR, etc

# Algos to bench

*It is very Important at this point to choose algos and then let everything bench first before moving onto pools, intervals, and delays but if you want to just mine one pool...please remove the algo's that are not in that pool you wish to mine at...

# Pools, Intervals, and Delays

1) Then go back into Splitsniffin.bat and select which pool you wish to be at and interval(in seconds) you would like to recheck the pools to see if another algo is worth switching too (Default is 90 seconds)

2) Delay(in seconds) for how long before miners switching from 1 instance of algo to another (Default is 1 second)
